This mod requires LATEST version of Geckolib and will not function without it.

Welcome to Starless, this is a mod that adds some entities for player to interact with. They can be friendly, neutral or hostile, depending on entity and type of day they spawn at.

I don't position this mod as horror, you won't find much of scary stuff here, nor this mod actually tries to be scary. This is what I personally call a "silly entity mod". Some of entities will assist you, some of them will want you dead, some of them won't do either.

The mod is originally meant to be complementary mod for no_moon.jar, but it can be played completely standalone just fine.
